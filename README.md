# Tezeta: A Package for Maximizing Context Window Utilization in Chatbots (Under Development)

> :warning: **Tezeta is currently under active development and is not yet functional. The features listed below are planned for future releases.**

Tezeta is a Python package designed to optimize memory in chatbots and Language Model (LLM) requests using relevance-based vector embeddings. This tool aims to maximize the utilization of context windows, thereby improving chatbot performance by allowing the storage and retrieval of more relevant conversation history.

## Planned Features

- Utilizes vector embeddings to rank conversational elements based on relevance.
- Supports different vector database types (currently planned support for Pinecone and ChromaDB).
- Allows easy switching between supported vector database types.

## Installation

Installation instructions will be provided upon the first functional release of Tezeta.

## Basic Usage

Basic usage instructions will be provided upon the first functional release of Tezeta.

## Documentation

Documentation will be available upon the first functional release of Tezeta.
